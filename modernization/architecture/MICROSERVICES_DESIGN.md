# ERP System Microservices Architecture Design

## Executive Summary

This document proposes a microservices architecture for the ERP System based on the analysis of **300+ domain entities** across **6 major business domains**. The design follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to establish clear bounded contexts, reduce coupling, and improve scalability and maintainability.

## Current State Analysis

The existing monolithic architecture contains tightly coupled entities across multiple business domains, leading to:
- Complex inter-domain relationships
- Performance bottlenecks from large entity graphs
- Difficult independent deployment and scaling
- Maintenance challenges due to cross-cutting concerns

## Proposed Microservices Architecture

```

### Audit Trail Service

**Purpose**: Comprehensive audit logging across all services.

#### Responsibilities:

## Inter-Service Communication

### Communication Patterns

#### 1. Synchronous Communication (REST APIs)
- **Use Case**: Real-time queries and immediate consistency requirements
- **Pattern**: Direct HTTP calls through API Gateway
- **Example**: Asset Service → Financial Service for settlement verification

#### 2. Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)
- **Use Case**: Domain events and eventual consistency
- **Pattern**: Message queues (Apache Kafka)
- **Example**: Asset created → Depreciation service starts calculations

#### 3. Data Synchronization
- **Use Case**: Reference data sharing
- **Pattern**: Event sourcing and CQRS
- **Example**: Fiscal calendar updates propagated to all services

### Event-Driven Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Bus (Apache Kafka)"
        TOPIC1[asset.events]
        TOPIC2[financial.events]
        TOPIC3[lease.events]
        TOPIC4[depreciation.events]
    end
    
    ASSET[Asset Service] --> TOPIC1
    FINANCIAL[Financial Service] --> TOPIC2
    LEASE[Lease Service] --> TOPIC3
    DEPRECIATION[Depreciation Service] --> TOPIC4
    
    TOPIC1 --> DEPRECIATION
    TOPIC1 --> AUDIT[Audit Service]
    TOPIC2 --> REPORTING[Reporting Service]
    TOPIC3 --> FINANCIAL
    TOPIC4 --> REPORTING
```

### Domain Events

#### Asset Domain Events:
- `AssetRegistered`
- `AssetCategoryChanged`
- `AssetDisposed`
- `AssetRevalued`

#### Financial Domain Events:
- `SettlementCreated`
- `PaymentProcessed`
- `InvoiceSettled`

#### Lease Domain Events:
- `LeaseContractCreated`
- `LeasePaymentMade`
- `LeaseLiabilityCalculated`

## Data Management Strategy

### Database per Service Pattern

Each microservice owns its data and database:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Asset Management"
        ASSET_SVC[Asset Service]
        ASSET_DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        ASSET_SVC --> ASSET_DB
    end
    
    subgraph "Financial Core"
        FIN_SVC[Financial Service]
        FIN_DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        FIN_SVC --> FIN_DB
    end
    
    subgraph "IFRS16 Leasing"
        LEASE_SVC[Lease Service]
        LEASE_DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        LEASE_SVC --> LEASE_DB
    end
    
    subgraph "Shared Reference Data"
        REF_SVC[Reference Service]
        REF_DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        REF_SVC --> REF_DB
    end
```

### Shared Reference Data

Common entities managed by dedicated service:
- `ServiceOutlet`
- `ApplicationUser`
- `Placeholder`
- `UniversallyUniqueMapping`

### Data Consistency Patterns

#### 1. Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Asset
    participant Financial
    participant Depreciation
    
    Client->>Asset: Create Asset
    Asset->>Asset: Save Asset
    Asset->>Financial: Verify Settlement
    Financial-->>Asset: Settlement Valid
    Asset->>Depreciation: Start Depreciation
    Depreciation-->>Asset: Depreciation Started
    Asset-->>Client: Asset Created
```

#### 2. Event Sourcing for Audit Trail
- All state changes captured as events
- Complete audit trail reconstruction
- Temporal queries and point-in-time recovery

## Benefits and Trade-offs

### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of services
- **Maintainability**: Clear service boundaries
- **Technology Diversity**: Different tech stacks per service
- **Team Autonomy**: Independent development and deployment
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity**: Distributed system challenges
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing across services

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Business Metrics**: Asset count, settlement volume, depreciation accuracy
- **Technical Metrics**: Response time, error rate, throughput
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage

### Alerting Strategy
- **Critical**: Service down, database connection failures
- **Warning**: High response times, error rate spikes
- **Info**: Deployment notifications, scaling events

## Conclusion

This microservices architecture provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for the ERP system while preserving business functionality. The design emphasizes clear domain boundaries, event-driven communication, and operational excellence through modern DevOps practices.

The migration should be executed incrementally to minimize risk and ensure business continuity throughout the transformation process.
