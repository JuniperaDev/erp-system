## Story Information

**Epic:** 1.1 Document Management Service Extraction  
**Story:** 1.1.1 Design Document Management Service Architecture  
**Epic Phase:** Phase 1  
**Business Domain:** Document Management  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  

## User Story

**As a** system architect and development team  
**I want** to design a comprehensive microservices architecture for extracting document management functionality from the monolithic ERP system  
**So that** we can achieve independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance of document management capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and production readiness  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Architecture Design
- [ ] **Current State Analysis**: Complete analysis of existing document management components including FileStorageService, domain entities, REST endpoints, and integration points
- [ ] **Microservice Architecture**: Design service boundaries, responsibilities, API specifications, and data models for the extracted service
- [ ] **Integration Patterns**: Define integration with remaining ERP modules, security systems, and external services
- [ ] **Database Migration Strategy**: Zero-downtime migration approach with data consistency planning

### Production-Readiness Gates
- [ ] **Gate 1 - Code Quality**: Standards, static analysis, documentation, and coding conventions
- [ ] **Gate 2 - Testing Excellence**: Unit (90% coverage), integration, E2E, and performance testing strategies
- [ ] **Gate 3 - Security Compliance**: JWT integration, RBAC, data encryption, audit logging
- [ ] **Gate 4 - Performance Standards**: SLA definitions, scalability requirements, resource optimization
- [ ] **Gate 5 - Operational Readiness**: Deployment automation, monitoring, logging, alerting, documentation

### Implementation Deliverables
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation**: Complete service design with current state analysis and target architecture
- [ ] **Service Interface Contracts**: REST API specifications, event schemas, configuration management
- [ ] **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased delivery approach with dependencies, risks, and success metrics
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Migration scripts and new document management tables
- [ ] **Service Implementation**: Core domain entities, service layer, repository layer, and API controllers

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] **Legacy API Support**: Maintain existing `/api/file-uploads` and `/api/business-documents` endpoints
- [ ] **Data Migration**: Dual-write pattern implementation for seamless transition
- [ ] **Integration Continuity**: Preserve existing security clearance and audit trail functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Service Architecture
- Microservice design following existing ERP patterns
- Integration with ApplicationUser, SecurityClearance, and Dealer entities
- File storage abstraction supporting filesystem and future cloud storage
- Elasticsearch integration for document search and indexing
- Event-driven integration for audit and notifications

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with versioning (`/api/v1/documents`)
- Backward compatible legacy endpoints (`/api/file-uploads`, `/api/business-documents`)
- Comprehensive CRUD operations with pagination and filtering
- File upload/download capabilities with integrity verification
- Search and metadata management endpoints

### Data Model
- Document entity with security integration and audit trail
- File metadata management with processing status tracking
- Checksum validation for file integrity (MD5/SHA-512)
- Soft delete functionality for audit compliance
- Version control for optimistic locking

### Security Integration
- JWT token validation from existing identity service
- Role-based access control with security clearance integration
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging for all document operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## Definition of Done

### Documentation
- [ ] Architecture design document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Production-readiness gates documentation with validation criteria
- [ ] Implementation roadmap with phased delivery plan
- [ ] API documentation with OpenAPI specifications
- [ ] Database migration scripts with rollback procedures

### Implementation
- [ ] Core service structure with domain entities and DTOs
- [ ] Service layer with complete CRUD operations
- [ ] Repository layer with JPA and Elasticsearch integration
- [ ] REST API controllers with v1 and legacy endpoints
- [ ] Configuration management for microservice settings

### Validation
- [ ] All 5 production-readiness gates addressed and documented
- [ ] Architecture review completed by technical team
- [ ] Security review for compliance requirements
- [ ] Performance requirements defined with SLA specifications
- [ ] Operational readiness validated with monitoring and deployment strategies

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Code quality standards met (static analysis, coverage)
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved
- [ ] Architecture patterns consistent with existing ERP system
- [ ] Integration points validated with existing services
- [ ] Migration strategy validated for zero-downtime requirements

## Dependencies

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes cluster for microservice deployment
- PostgreSQL database for document metadata
- Elasticsearch cluster for search functionality
- Redis cache for performance optimization
- File storage system (filesystem/cloud)

### Services
- Identity service for JWT authentication
- API gateway for routing and rate limiting
- Message queue for event-driven integration
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Logging infrastructure (ELK stack)

### Team
- Architecture review by technical lead
- Security review by security team
- Database review by DBA team
- Operations review for deployment readiness
- Business stakeholder validation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Data Loss During Migration**: Comprehensive backup and validation procedures required
- **Performance Degradation**: Extensive load testing and monitoring needed
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security review and penetration testing required
- **Integration Failures**: Circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms needed

### Mitigation Strategies
- Phased implementation with incremental validation
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Rollback procedures for all changes
- Monitoring and alerting for early issue detection

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 90% unit test coverage achieved
- All performance SLAs defined and validated
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Complete documentation coverage

### Business Metrics
- 100% feature parity with existing functionality
- Zero data loss during migration
- Seamless user experience transition
- Improved system maintainability and scalability

## Notes

This story establishes the foundation for Epic 1.1: Document Management Service Extraction by providing comprehensive architecture design and implementation planning. The design maintains backward compatibility while enabling modern microservices patterns for improved scalability and maintainability.

The implementation follows all development methodology requirements including the 5 production-readiness gates and GitHub project management workflow rules.
