# Reporting Bounded Context

## Context Overview

The Reporting bounded context is responsible for cross-domain reporting, analytics, and dashboard data provision. This context aggregates data from all other bounded contexts to provide comprehensive business intelligence, regulatory reporting, and operational dashboards.

## Business Responsibilities

- Cross-domain data aggregation and reporting
- Financial and operational dashboard provision
- Regulatory compliance reporting
- Business intelligence and analytics
- Report template management and generation
- Scheduled report delivery and distribution
- Data visualization and presentation

## Core Domain Entities

  - `reportName` (report identifier)
  - `reportDate` (generation date)
  - `reportStatus` (current status)
  - `reportParameters` (configuration parameters)
  - `reportFormat` (output format)
- **Business Rules**:
  - Report names must be unique per period
  - Report parameters must be valid for report type
  - Status transitions must follow defined workflow

#### ReportTemplate
- **Purpose**: Report template definition and management
- **Key Attributes**: `templateName`, `templateCode`, `reportType`
- **Business Rules**:
  - Template codes must be unique
  - Templates must have valid data source mappings

### Supporting Entities

#### AutonomousReport
- **Purpose**: Self-generating scheduled reports
- **Key Attributes**: `reportSchedule`, `lastGeneration`, `nextGeneration`
- **Relationship**: Uses ReportTemplate for generation

#### ExcelReportExport
- **Purpose**: Excel format report generation
- **Key Attributes**: `fileName`, `sheetConfiguration`, `exportDate`
- **Relationship**: Generated from ReportRequisition

#### PdfReportRequisition
- **Purpose**: PDF format report generation
- **Key Attributes**: `pdfConfiguration`, `pageLayout`, `formatting`
- **Relationship**: Generated from ReportRequisition

## Cross-Context Data Sources

### Asset Management Context
- Asset registers and valuations
- Asset disposal and revaluation reports
- Asset category and location analysis
- Asset lifecycle and maintenance reports

### Financial Core Context
- Settlement and payment reports
- Vendor and supplier analysis
- Invoice and purchase order reports
- Financial transaction summaries

### IFRS16 Leasing Context
- Lease liability and ROU asset reports
- Lease payment schedules and analysis
- IFRS16 compliance and disclosure reports
- Lease portfolio analytics

### Depreciation Context
- Depreciation calculation reports
- Net book value analysis
- Depreciation method and rate reports
- Asset valuation summaries

### Work-in-Progress Context
- WIP inventory and valuation reports
- Project progress and completion analysis
- WIP transfer and capitalization reports
- Project cost and budget analysis

## Context Boundaries

### What's Inside the Context
- Report generation and formatting logic
- Cross-domain data aggregation
- Report template management
- Scheduled report processing
- Report distribution and delivery
- Dashboard data preparation

### What's Outside the Context
- Source data creation and maintenance (other contexts)
- Business logic and calculations (domain contexts)
- Transaction processing (operational contexts)
- Master data management (shared kernel)

## Integration Points

### Inbound Dependencies
- **Asset Data**: Receives asset information from Asset Management
- **Financial Data**: Receives transaction data from Financial Core
- **Lease Data**: Receives lease information from IFRS16 Leasing
- **Depreciation Data**: Receives calculation data from Depreciation
- **WIP Data**: Receives project data from Work-in-Progress

### Outbound Services
- **Report Delivery**: Provides generated reports to users
- **Dashboard APIs**: Serves dashboard data to frontend applications
- **Data Exports**: Provides data extracts for external systems
- **Analytics APIs**: Serves analytical data for business intelligence

### Anti-Corruption Layers Required
- **Data Harmonization**: Standardize data formats across contexts
- **Currency Normalization**: Handle multi-currency reporting
- **Date Standardization**: Align fiscal periods and reporting dates
- **Unit Conversion**: Standardize measurement units across domains

## Data Consistency Requirements

### Eventual Consistency
- All cross-context data aggregation
- Report data synchronization
- Dashboard data updates
- Analytics data preparation

### Read-Only Operations
- Reporting context is primarily read-only
- No direct modification of source domain data
- Report generation does not affect operational data

## API Boundaries

### Public Interface
```yaml
POST   /api/reports/generate         # Generate report
GET    /api/reports/{id}             # Get report
GET    /api/reports/templates        # List templates
POST   /api/reports/schedule         # Schedule report
GET    /api/dashboards/data          # Dashboard data
GET    /api/analytics/summary        # Analytics summary
POST   /api/reports/export           # Export data
GET    /api/reports/status/{id}      # Report status
```

### Internal Services
- ReportGenerationService
- ReportTemplateService
- DashboardDataService
- AnalyticsService
- ReportDistributionService
- DataAggregationService

## Report Categories

### Financial Reports
- **Asset Reports**: Asset registers, valuations, disposals
- **Settlement Reports**: Payment summaries, vendor analysis

## Business Rules and Invariants

1. **Data Accuracy**: Reports must reflect accurate source data
2. **Timeliness**: Reports must be generated within defined SLAs
3. **Consistency**: Cross-context data must be properly reconciled
4. **Security**: Report access must follow authorization rules
5. **Audit Trail**: Report generation must be fully auditable
6. **Format Standards**: Reports must follow organizational standards

## Migration Considerations

### Current State
- Reports scattered across multiple modules
- Inconsistent data aggregation logic
- Manual report generation processes

### Target State
