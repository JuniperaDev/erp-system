# State locking configuration
# Azure Storage automatically provides state locking when using azurerm backend
# No additional configuration required for basic locking

# For enhanced security, consider using:
# - Service Principal authentication with client certificates
# - Managed Identity authentication for Azure-hosted CI/CD systems
# - Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive backend configuration
