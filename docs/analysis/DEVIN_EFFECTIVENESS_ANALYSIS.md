## What Didn't Work Well: Areas for Improvement

### 1. Infrastructure Issue Cascade ⚠️

**Issue**: Sequential PRs needed to resolve interconnected infrastructure problems, indicating insufficient upfront analysis.

**Specific Examples**:
- **PRs #82-90**: 9 sequential PRs over 4 days to resolve startup issues
  - PR #82: Database user mismatch and circular dependency
  - PR #83: Missing ERP_DOCUMENTS_MAX_FILE_SIZE default
  - PR #84: Elasticsearch port mapping issues
  - PR #85: Database creation and index configuration
  - PR #86: UPLOADS_SIZE configuration binding error
  - PR #87: Liquibase XML validation error
  - PR #88: Post-merge errors with missing columns
  - PR #89: Missing settlement_group_id column
  - PR #90: Migration execution order problems

**Quantified Impact**:
- 32% of all PRs (9/28) were sequential infrastructure fixes
- Estimated 3-4x ACU consumption vs. comprehensive upfront analysis
- User frustration with repeated "almost working" states

**Root Cause**: Insufficient local environment validation before starting changes.

### 2. Oversized PR Complexity ⚠️

**Issue**: Some PRs were extremely large, making review, testing, and rollback challenging.

**Specific Examples**:
- **PR #77**: 5,148 additions, 4,701 deletions, 183 files - Entity naming standardization
- **PR #76**: 4,869 additions, 238 deletions, 86 files - Intermediate entities
- **PR #1**: 4,259 additions, 8 files - Domain documentation

**Quantified Impact**:
- 3 PRs exceeded 4,000 line changes
- Review time likely 3-5x longer for oversized PRs
- Higher risk of introducing subtle bugs in large refactoring

**Root Cause**: Attempting to complete entire epics in single PRs rather than breaking into logical phases.

### 3. Limited Local Testing Validation ⚠️

**Issue**: Several PRs noted inability to run full test suites due to environmental constraints.

**Specific Examples**:
- **PR #98**: "Due to pre-existing compilation errors in unrelated files, I was unable to run the actual test suite"
- **PR #81**: Testing limitations noted in PR description
- Multiple PRs relied on CI/CD pipeline validation rather than local verification

**Quantified Impact**:
- ~30% of PRs had limited local testing verification
- Increased dependency on CI for feedback loops
- Potential for runtime issues not caught locally

**Root Cause**: Incomplete local development environment setup procedures.

### 4. Reactive vs. Proactive Architecture Planning ⚠️

**Issue**: Many PRs were reactive fixes rather than proactive architectural improvements.

**Analysis**:
- 60% of PRs were fixes for issues discovered during development
- Limited evidence of comprehensive upfront analysis for complex changes
- Pattern of "implement then fix" rather than "analyze then implement"

**Quantified Impact**:
- Estimated 40-50% higher ACU consumption due to reactive approach
- Increased development friction and context switching
- Suboptimal architectural decisions made under pressure

## ACU Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Comprehensive Environment Setup (High Impact)

**Current State**: 60% of PRs were infrastructure fixes
**Target State**: <20% infrastructure fixes through better setup

**Recommendation**: 
- Invest 2-3 ACU sessions in comprehensive environment documentation
- Create automated environment validation scripts
- Establish testing prerequisites checklist

**Estimated ACU Savings**: 40-50% reduction in fix sessions

### 2. Epic Decomposition Strategy (Medium Impact)

**Current State**: Large monolithic PRs (5,000+ line changes)
**Target State**: Logical phase-based implementation

**Recommendation**:
```
Epic Implementation Pattern:
├── Phase 1: Analysis & Design (15% ACUs)
├── Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (25% ACUs)  
├── Phase 3: Business Logic (35% ACUs)
└── Phase 4: Integration & Testing (25% ACUs)
```

**Estimated ACU Savings**: 25-30% through better planning and reduced rework

### 3. Upfront Analysis Investment (High Impact)

**Current State**: 5% ACUs on planning, 95% on implementation
**Target State**: 25% ACUs on planning, 75% on implementation

**Recommendation**:
- Comprehensive architectural analysis before coding
- Dependency mapping and risk assessment
- Integration point identification

**Estimated ACU Savings**: 35-40% through reduced reactive fixes

### 4. Local Testing Environment Standardization (Medium Impact)

**Current State**: Limited local testing capability
**Target State**: Reliable local development environment

**Recommendation**:
- Document complete local setup procedures
- Create Docker-based development environment
- Establish pre-commit testing workflows

**Estimated ACU Savings**: 20-25% through faster feedback loops

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices (Repository-Specific)

### 1. ERP System Context Provision ✅

**Effective Pattern**:
```
"In the JuniperaDev/erp-system repository with 376 domain entities, 
implement [feature] following the existing domain event infrastructure 
pattern established in PR #80, maintaining backward compatibility 
with current AssetRegistration relationships."
```

**Why It Works**: Provides specific architectural context and constraints.

### 2. Scope Boundary Definition ✅

**Effective Pattern**:
```
"Fix only the Elasticsearch configuration issues in the testcontainers 
profile. Do not modify existing search functionality, entity relationships, 
or production Elasticsearch configuration."
```

**Why It Works**: Prevents scope creep in complex enterprise system.

### 3. Testing Requirements Specification ✅

**Effective Pattern**:
```
"Verify integration tests pass with both PostgreSQL and H2 databases, 
application starts without errors, and new audit trail endpoints 
return expected IFRS16 compliance data."
```

**Why It Works**: Addresses specific ERP system testing complexity.

### 4. Dependency Chain Awareness ✅

**Effective Pattern**:
```
"Prerequisites: Settlement circular dependencies must be resolved (PR #72), 
domain event infrastructure must be available (PR #80), and Liquibase 
migrations must execute successfully before implementing financial events."
```

**Why It Works**: Acknowledges complex interdependencies in enterprise system.

## Task Structuring Recommendations (ERP-Specific)

### 1. Domain-Driven Epic Structure

**Recommended Pattern for ERP System**:
```
Epic: Financial Domain Modernization
├── Analysis Session: Domain boundary analysis (20% ACUs)
├── Infrastructure Session: Event infrastructure setup (25% ACUs)
├── Core Session: Financial entity implementation (30% ACUs)
└── Integration Session: Cross-domain integration (25% ACUs)
```

### 2. Risk-First Approach

**Pattern for Complex Enterprise Changes**:
```
High-Risk Items (Address First):
- Settlement circular dependencies
- IFRS16 compliance logic validation  
- Data migration integrity
- Cross-domain relationship impacts

Low-Risk Items (Batch Together):
- Entity naming standardization
- Repository pattern implementation
- REST API generation
- Documentation updates
```

### 3. Compliance-Aware Planning

**Pattern for Regulatory Requirements**:
```
Compliance Checkpoints:
- IFRS16 calculation accuracy validation
- Audit trail completeness verification
- Data retention policy compliance
- Financial reporting accuracy confirmation
```
