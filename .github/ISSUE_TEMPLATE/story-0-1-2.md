## Story Information

**Epic:** 0.1 Azure Infrastructure Deployment  
**Story:** 0.1.2 Implement Core Azure Infrastructure Modules  
**Epic Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation)  
**Business Domain:** Infrastructure & DevOps  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** Critical  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer and infrastructure team  
**I want** to implement comprehensive Terraform modules for all Azure infrastructure components  
**So that** we can deploy scalable, secure, and maintainable infrastructure that supports the 6 ERP microservices with proper networking, database, messaging, storage, monitoring, and security capabilities  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Infrastructure Modules
- [ ] **Networking Module**: Azure Virtual Network with subnets, NSGs, and Application Gateway
- [ ] **AKS Module**: Azure Kubernetes Service with auto-scaling, node pools, and Azure AD integration
- [ ] **Database Module**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with HA and backup
- [ ] **Messaging Module**: Azure Event Hubs with 6 topics and consumer groups for each microservice
- [ ] **Storage Module**: Azure Blob Storage with private endpoints and container organization
- [ ] **Monitoring Module**: Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics workspace
- [ ] **Security Module**: Azure Key Vault, Managed Identity, and security policies

### Production-Readiness Gates
- [ ] **Gate 1 - Code Quality**: Terraform best practices, linting, and documentation standards
- [ ] **Gate 2 - Testing Excellence**: Module validation, plan testing, and integration testing
- [ ] **Gate 3 - Security Compliance**: Security scanning, policy validation, and access controls
- [ ] **Gate 4 - Performance Standards**: Resource sizing, scaling policies, and performance optimization
- [ ] **Gate 5 - Operational Readiness**: Monitoring integration, alerting, and backup procedures

### Environment Configurations
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Cost-optimized resources with basic monitoring
- [ ] **Staging Environment**: Production-like setup with reduced capacity
- [ ] **Production Environment**: Full HA configuration with comprehensive monitoring and backup

### Module Integration
- [ ] **Cross-Module Dependencies**: Proper output/input mapping between modules
- [ ] **Variable Management**: Centralized variable definitions with environment-specific overrides
- [ ] **State Management**: Remote state configuration with locking and versioning
- [ ] **Module Versioning**: Semantic versioning and change management

## Technical Requirements

### Networking Module (`modules/networking/`)
- Azure Virtual Network with dedicated subnets for AKS, databases, and services
- Network Security Groups with least privilege access rules
- Azure Application Gateway for ingress with SSL termination and WAF
- Private endpoints for secure database and storage access
- Route tables and service endpoints configuration

### AKS Module (`modules/aks/`)
- Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with system and user node pools
- Auto-scaling configuration (min: 2, max: 10 nodes per pool)
- Azure AD integration for RBAC and authentication
- Azure Container Registry integration for image management
- Cluster monitoring and logging integration

### Database Module (`modules/database/`)
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
- High availability configuration with zone redundancy
- Automated backup with point-in-time recovery
- Private endpoint connectivity for secure access
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### Messaging Module (`modules/messaging/`)
- Azure Event Hubs namespace with auto-scaling
- 6 Event Hubs for microservice topics: asset_events, financial_events, lease_events, depreciation_batch, wip_events, reporting_events
- Consumer groups for each microservice
- Authorization rules and connection string management
- Integration with Azure Key Vault for secrets

### Storage Module (`modules/storage/`)
- Azure Blob Storage account with private endpoints
- Container organization: documents, reports, backups, audit-logs
- Lifecycle management policies for cost optimization
- Access tier management and archival policies
- Integration with Azure Key Vault for access keys

### Monitoring Module (`modules/monitoring/`)
- Azure Monitor workspace with custom metrics
- Application Insights for microservices observability
- Log Analytics workspace for centralized logging
- Custom dashboards for infrastructure and application metrics
- Alerting rules for critical infrastructure events

### Security Module (`modules/security/`)
- Azure Key Vault with access policies and RBAC
- User-assigned Managed Identity for AKS and services
- Azure Policy assignments for compliance
- Security Center integration for threat detection
- Network security baseline implementation

## Definition of Done

### Implementation
- [ ] All 7 Terraform modules implemented with complete functionality
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations for dev, staging, and production
- [ ] Module documentation with input/output specifications
- [ ] Variable definitions with validation and descriptions
- [ ] Output definitions for cross-module integration

### Validation
- [ ] All modules pass `terraform validate` successfully
- [ ] Terraform plans generate without errors for all environments
- [ ] Module integration testing completed
- [ ] Security scanning passed for all configurations
- [ ] Cost estimation validated against budget constraints

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Code review completed by infrastructure team
- [ ] Terraform best practices validated (naming, structure, documentation)
- [ ] Security review for Azure compliance requirements
- [ ] Performance requirements validated with resource sizing
- [ ] Operational readiness confirmed with monitoring integration

### Documentation
- [ ] Module README files with usage examples
- [ ] Variable documentation with types and descriptions
- [ ] Output documentation for integration guidance
- [ ] Deployment guide with step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Dependencies

### Infrastructure
- Azure subscription with required service quotas
- Terraform CLI (>= 1.0) with Azure provider
- Azure CLI for authentication and management
- Git repository for state management and versioning

### Services
- Azure Resource Manager for resource deployment
- Azure Active Directory for authentication integration
- Azure Monitor for observability and alerting
- Azure Security Center for compliance monitoring

### Team
- Infrastructure architecture review by cloud team
- Security validation by security team
- Cost optimization review by finance team
- Operational readiness review by DevOps team

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Module Dependencies**: Complex inter-module dependencies could cause deployment failures
- **Resource Limits**: Azure service quotas might limit scaling capabilities
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Improper access controls could create security vulnerabilities
- **Cost Overruns**: Incorrect resource sizing could exceed budget constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive module testing with dependency validation
- Azure quota review and increase requests before deployment
- Security baseline validation and compliance checking
- Cost monitoring and alerting implementation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All 7 modules deploy successfully in all environments
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in infrastructure code
- Terraform plan execution time under 5 minutes per environment
- 100% module documentation coverage

### Business Metrics
- Infrastructure ready for microservices deployment
- Cost estimates within approved budget ranges
- Security compliance validated for enterprise requirements
- Operational monitoring and alerting functional

## Notes

This story implements the core infrastructure foundation that will support all 6 ERP microservices. The modules must be production-ready with proper security, monitoring, and operational capabilities.

The implementation follows Terraform best practices and Azure Well-Architected Framework principles for reliability, security, cost optimization, and operational excellence.
