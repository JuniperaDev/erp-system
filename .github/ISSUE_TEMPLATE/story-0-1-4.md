## Story Information

**Epic:** 0.1 Azure Infrastructure Deployment  
**Story:** 0.1.4 Deploy Infrastructure to Development Environment  
**Epic Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation)  
**Business Domain:** Infrastructure & DevOps  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** Medium  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer and development team  
**I want** to deploy and validate the complete Azure infrastructure in the development environment  
**So that** we can verify all infrastructure components work correctly before proceeding to staging and production deployments  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] **Terraform Deployment**: Successfully deploy all 7 infrastructure modules to Azure dev environment
- [ ] **Service Validation**: Verify all Azure services are created and configured correctly
- [ ] **Network Connectivity**: Validate connectivity between AKS, PostgreSQL, Event Hubs, and storage
- [ ] **Security Configuration**: Confirm Key Vault, managed identity, and access policies are functional

### Production-Readiness Gates
- [ ] **Gate 1 - Deployment Success**: All Terraform modules deploy without errors
- [ ] **Gate 2 - Service Health**: All Azure services pass health checks and connectivity tests
- [ ] **Gate 3 - Security Validation**: Key Vault access, managed identity, and network security functional
- [ ] **Gate 4 - Performance Baseline**: Resource utilization and performance metrics within expected ranges
- [ ] **Gate 5 - Operational Readiness**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting systems functional

### Service Connectivity Testing
- [ ] **AKS Cluster**: Cluster accessible and kubectl commands functional
- [ ] **PostgreSQL Database**: Connection successful with proper authentication
- [ ] **Event Hubs**: Kafka connectivity and topic creation/consumption working
- [ ] **Blob Storage**: File upload/download and container access functional
- [ ] **Key Vault**: Secret retrieval and CSI driver integration working
- [ ] **Application Insights**: Telemetry collection and dashboard visibility

### Microservice Deployment Testing
- [ ] **Sample Deployment**: Deploy one microservice (Asset Management) to validate end-to-end functionality
- [ ] **Database Connectivity**: Microservice can connect to PostgreSQL and perform CRUD operations
- [ ] **Event Publishing**: Microservice can publish events to Event Hubs topics
- [ ] **Secret Access**: Microservice can retrieve secrets from Key Vault via CSI driver
- [ ] **Monitoring Integration**: Application metrics appear in Azure Monitor and Application Insights

## Technical Requirements

### Terraform Deployment
- Execute `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` for dev environment
- Validate all resources are created with correct configurations
- Verify resource tags, naming conventions, and cost allocation
- Confirm state management and locking mechanisms work correctly

### Azure Service Configuration
- **AKS**: 2-node cluster with system and user node pools
- **PostgreSQL**: Basic tier with 2 vCores and 100GB storage
- **Event Hubs**: Basic tier with 1 throughput unit
- **Storage**: Standard LRS with lifecycle management
- **Key Vault**: Standard tier with access policies configured
- **Monitoring**: Basic Application Insights with 90-day retention

### Network and Security Testing
- Private endpoint connectivity for PostgreSQL and storage
- Network security group rules allowing required traffic
- Managed identity authentication to Azure services
- Key Vault access policies for AKS cluster identity

### Cost Monitoring
- Validate actual costs align with estimates (~$400/month for dev)
- Configure cost alerts and budget monitoring
- Review resource utilization and optimization opportunities

## Definition of Done

### Deployment Validation
- [ ] All Terraform modules deploy successfully without errors
- [ ] Azure resources created match specifications and naming conventions
- [ ] Resource groups, tags, and cost allocation configured correctly
- [ ] State file stored securely with proper locking mechanism

### Connectivity Testing
- [ ] AKS cluster accessible via kubectl with proper RBAC
- [ ] PostgreSQL database accepts connections with authentication
- [ ] Event Hubs topics created and accessible via Kafka protocol
- [ ] Blob storage containers accessible with proper permissions
- [ ] Key Vault secrets retrievable via managed identity

### Integration Validation
- [ ] Sample microservice deploys successfully on AKS
- [ ] Database schema creation and migration successful
- [ ] Event publishing and consumption working correctly
- [ ] Secret injection from Key Vault functional
- [ ] Application metrics visible in Azure Monitor

### Operational Readiness
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured and displaying data
- [ ] Log aggregation working for all services
- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting runbook created for common issues

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with sufficient quotas and permissions
- Terraform CLI configured with Azure authentication
- kubectl configured for AKS cluster access
- Azure CLI for manual validation and troubleshooting

### Infrastructure Components
- All Terraform modules completed and validated
- Azure service quotas approved for required resources
- DNS configuration for custom domains (if applicable)
- SSL certificates for secure communication

### Team Access
- Development team access to Azure subscription
- AKS cluster access for application deployment
- Key Vault permissions for secret management
- Monitoring dashboard access for operations team

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Azure Service Limits**: Resource quotas might prevent deployment
- **Network Connectivity**: Private endpoints and NSG rules might block traffic
- **Authentication Issues**: Managed identity or Key Vault access problems
- **Cost Overruns**: Unexpected resource usage exceeding budget

### Mitigation Strategies
- Pre-deployment quota validation and increase requests
- Network connectivity testing with step-by-step validation
- Authentication troubleshooting procedures and fallback options
- Real-time cost monitoring with automatic alerts

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 100% successful Terraform deployment rate
- Zero critical connectivity issues
- All health checks passing for deployed services
- Response times within acceptable ranges

### Operational Metrics
- Infrastructure deployment time under 30 minutes
- Zero manual intervention required for deployment
- All monitoring and alerting systems functional
- Cost within 10% of estimated budget

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Azure subscription quotas verified
- [ ] Terraform state backend configured
- [ ] Authentication and permissions validated
- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerts configured

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] All Azure resources created successfully
- [ ] Network connectivity tests passed
- [ ] Security configurations validated
- [ ] Sample application deployment successful
- [ ] Monitoring and logging functional

## Notes

This story serves as the critical validation step for the entire Azure infrastructure before proceeding to staging and production environments. Success here ensures confidence in the infrastructure design and implementation.

The development environment deployment provides the foundation for all subsequent microservice development and testing activities.
