# ERP System Modernization Initiative

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for modernizing the ERP System from a monolithic architecture to a cloud-native microservices architecture. The modernization initiative encompasses domain model improvements, cloud deployment strategies, and detailed migration planning.

## Folder Structure

### üìÅ architecture/
Contains domain analysis and microservices architecture design:
- `DOMAIN_ENTITIES.md` - Comprehensive domain entity documentation
- `DOMAIN_MODEL_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Analysis of current model and improvement recommendations
- `MICROSERVICES_DESIGN.md` - Proposed microservices architecture design
- `UPDATED_TECH_STACK.md` - Re-evaluated technology stack recommendations

### üìÅ deployment/
Contains cloud platform evaluations and deployment strategies:
- `CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_EVALUATION.md` - Comprehensive analysis of AWS, Azure, and GCP options

### üìÅ backlog/
Contains actionable work items for implementation:
- `DOMAIN_IMPROVEMENTS_BACKLOG.md` - Prioritized backlog for domain model improvements
- `MIGRATION_STRATEGY_BACKLOG.md` - Phased migration planning and work items


## Executive Summary

The ERP System modernization initiative addresses the current monolithic architecture's limitations by:

1. **Domain Model Optimization**: Reducing relationship complexity, implementing domain events, and establishing clear aggregate boundaries
2. **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Leveraging managed services from AWS, Azure, or GCP for improved scalability and reduced operational overhead
3. **Microservices Migration**: Phased extraction of services following Domain-Driven Design principles
4. **Technology Stack Updates**: Adopting latest versions and cloud-native alternatives for improved performance and maintainability

## Key Benefits

- **50-70% reduction** in query complexity for asset operations
- **Improved scalability** through independent service scaling
- **Enhanced maintainability** with clear service boundaries
- **Reduced operational overhead** using managed cloud services
- **Better fault isolation** preventing cascading failures

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Months 1-2): Extract supporting services
- **Phase 2** (Months 3-6): Extract core business services  
- **Phase 3** (Months 7-8): Extract processing services
- **Phase 4** (Months 9-12): Optimize and scale

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Team**: 6-8 developers with microservices experience
- **DevOps Engineers**: 2-3 engineers for cloud infrastructure and CI/CD
- **Architecture Lead**: 1 senior architect for design oversight
- **Project Manager**: 1 PM for coordination and timeline management

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Response time improvements of 40-60%
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of high-load services
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with improved fault tolerance
- **Development Velocity**: 30-50% faster feature delivery post-migration

## Getting Started

1. Review the architecture documentation in `architecture/`
2. Evaluate cloud deployment options in `deployment/`
3. Plan implementation using backlog items in `backlog/`
