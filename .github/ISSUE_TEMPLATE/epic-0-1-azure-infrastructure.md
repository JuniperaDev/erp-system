## Epic Information

**Epic:** 0.1 Azure Infrastructure Deployment  
**Epic Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation)  
**Business Domain:** Infrastructure & DevOps  
**Total Story Points:** 42  
**Priority:** Critical  

## Epic Overview

**As a** DevOps team and system architects  
**I want** to establish comprehensive Azure cloud infrastructure for the ERP System microservices using Terraform as Infrastructure as Code  
**So that** we can deploy, scale, and manage the 6 microservices (Asset Management, Financial Core, Lease, Depreciation, WIP, Reporting) in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective Azure environment  

## Epic Scope

### Infrastructure Components
- **Container Orchestration**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with auto-scaling
- **Database**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with HA
- **Messaging**: Azure Event Hubs (Kafka-compatible) for 6 microservice topics
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage with private endpoints
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault + Managed Identity for secrets management
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor + Application Insights for observability
- **Networking**: Virtual Network with subnets and security groups

### Cost Estimates
- **Development**: ~$400/month
- **Staging**: ~$800/month  
- **Production**: ~$1,702/month

## Stories in this Epic

### Story 0.1.1: Design Azure Terraform Infrastructure Architecture (8 points)
- Complete architecture design for Azure infrastructure
- Define Terraform module structure and dependencies
- Create infrastructure documentation and deployment guides

### Story 0.1.2: Implement Core Azure Infrastructure Modules (13 points)
- Develop Terraform modules for networking, AKS, database, messaging
- Implement storage, monitoring, and security modules
- Create environment-specific configurations

### Story 0.1.3: Migrate Kubernetes Configurations to Azure (8 points)
- Transform existing K8s manifests for Azure services
- Implement Azure Key Vault integration for secrets
- Update service configurations for Azure endpoints

### Story 0.1.4: Deploy Infrastructure to Development Environment (5 points)
- Deploy and validate dev environment infrastructure
- Test all Azure service connectivity and integration
- Validate microservices deployment capabilities

### Story 0.1.5: Deploy Infrastructure to Production Environment (8 points)
- Deploy production infrastructure with HA configuration
- Implement monitoring, alerting, and backup strategies
- Validate security and compliance requirements

## Success Criteria

### Technical Deliverables
- [ ] Complete Terraform infrastructure modules for all Azure services
- [ ] Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Azure-specific Kubernetes manifests with Key Vault integration
- [ ] Comprehensive deployment documentation
- [ ] Cost optimization and monitoring implementation

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] All Terraform configurations validate successfully
- [ ] Infrastructure deploys without errors in dev environment
- [ ] All 6 microservices can connect to Azure services
- [ ] Security configurations meet enterprise requirements
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems are functional

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Terraform CLI installed and configured
- Azure CLI access for deployment
- Kubernetes CLI for cluster management

### Integration Points
- Existing microservices codebase
- Current Kubernetes configurations
- JHipster Registry for service discovery
- Existing security and authentication systems

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Azure Service Availability**: Ensure all required services available in target regions
- **Cost Overruns**: Monitor and optimize resource sizing
- **Security Compliance**: Validate enterprise security requirements
- **Migration Complexity**: Plan careful transition from existing infrastructure

### Mitigation Strategies
- Phased deployment starting with development environment
- Comprehensive testing and validation at each phase
- Cost monitoring and alerting implementation
- Security review and compliance validation

## Notes

This epic establishes the foundation infrastructure for the entire ERP System microservices modernization project. All subsequent phases depend on successful completion of this infrastructure deployment.

The implementation follows Azure best practices and enterprise security requirements while maintaining cost optimization and operational excellence.
