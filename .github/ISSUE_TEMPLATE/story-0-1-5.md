**Story:** 0.1.5 Deploy Infrastructure to Production Environment  
**Epic Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation)  
**Business Domain:** Infrastructure & DevOps  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Critical  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer and operations team  
**I want** to deploy production-grade Azure infrastructure with high availability, security, and monitoring capabilities  
**So that** we can support the ERP System microservices in production with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and performance requirements  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Production Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] **High Availability Configuration**: Multi-zone deployment for AKS, PostgreSQL, and Event Hubs
- [ ] **Security Hardening**: Enterprise security policies, private endpoints, and network isolation
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Comprehensive observability with proactive alerting and dashboards
- [ ] **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Automated backup strategies and recovery procedures

### Production-Readiness Gates
- [ ] **Gate 1 - Enterprise Security**: Security baseline, compliance validation, and threat protection
- [ ] **Gate 2 - High Availability**: Multi-zone redundancy and failover capabilities
- [ ] **Gate 3 - Performance Excellence**: SLA compliance and performance optimization
- [ ] **Gate 4 - Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, alerting, and incident response procedures
- [ ] **Gate 5 - Business Continuity**: Backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning

### Production Service Configuration
- [ ] **AKS Production Cluster**: 3+ nodes across multiple zones with auto-scaling (2-10 nodes)
- [ ] **PostgreSQL HA**: Zone-redundant deployment with automated backup and point-in-time recovery
- [ ] **Event Hubs Premium**: Auto-scaling with dedicated capacity and geo-disaster recovery
- [ ] **Storage Premium**: Zone-redundant storage with lifecycle management and compliance features
- [ ] **Key Vault Premium**: HSM-backed keys with advanced access policies and audit logging
- [ ] **Application Insights Premium**: Advanced analytics with 730-day retention and custom metrics

### Security and Compliance
- [ ] **Network Security**: Private endpoints, NSGs, and Azure Firewall integration
- [ ] **Identity and Access**: Azure AD integration, RBAC, and privileged access management
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, key rotation, and compliance logging
- [ ] **Threat Protection**: Azure Security Center, threat detection, and incident response

## Technical Requirements

### High Availability Architecture
- **AKS**: Multi-zone node pools with zone-redundant load balancer
- **PostgreSQL**: Zone-redundant HA with automatic failover
- **Event Hubs**: Premium tier with geo-disaster recovery pairing
- **Storage**: Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) with cross-region replication
- **Application Gateway**: Zone-redundant deployment with multiple instances

### Security Configuration
- **Network Isolation**: Private endpoints for all Azure services
- **Access Control**: Azure AD integration with conditional access policies
- **Secret Management**: Key Vault with HSM-backed keys and access policies
- **Compliance**: Azure Policy assignments for regulatory compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all infrastructure operations

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Azure Monitor with custom dashboards and workbooks
- **Application Monitoring**: Application Insights with distributed tracing
- **Log Analytics**: Centralized logging with KQL queries and alerts
- **Performance Monitoring**: SLA tracking and performance optimization
- **Cost Management**: Budget alerts and cost optimization recommendations

### Backup and Disaster Recovery
- **Database Backup**: Automated daily backups with 35-day retention
- **Configuration Backup**: Infrastructure as Code versioning and rollback procedures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region replication and recovery procedures
- **Business Continuity**: RTO/RPO targets and recovery testing procedures
