## Business Responsibilities

- Payment processing and settlement management
- Vendor and dealer relationship management
- Invoice processing and payment tracking
- Purchase order management
- Multi-currency transaction support
- Chart of accounts maintenance
- Financial transaction audit trail

### Supporting Entities

#### PaymentInvoice
- **Purpose**: Invoice management and tracking
- **Key Attributes**: `invoiceNumber`, `invoiceDate`, `invoiceAmount`
- **Relationship**: Many-to-many with Settlement

#### PurchaseOrder

## External Dependencies

### Asset Management Context
- **Asset Acquisition**: Provides settlement data for asset purchases
- **Asset Disposal**: Receives disposal proceeds information

### Work-in-Progress Context
- **Project Payments**: Provides settlement data for WIP transactions
- **Vendor Payments**: Manages supplier payments for projects

### IFRS16 Leasing Context
- **Lease Payments**: Processes lease payment settlements
- **Lease Vendors**: Manages lessor information

### Shared Kernel
- **ServiceOutlet**: Branch/location information for transactions
- **ApplicationUser**: User information for transaction authorization
- **BusinessDocument**: Document management for financial records

## Context Boundaries

### What's Inside the Context
- All payment and settlement processing
- Vendor and dealer management
- Invoice and purchase order lifecycle
- Currency and exchange rate management
- Payment categorization and grouping
- Financial transaction authorization

### What's Outside the Context
- Asset valuation and depreciation (Asset Management/Depreciation)
- Lease accounting calculations (IFRS16 Leasing)
- Project cost accumulation (Work-in-Progress)
- Financial reporting and analytics (Reporting)

## Integration Points

### Inbound Dependencies
- **Asset Purchases**: Receives asset acquisition requests from Asset Management
- **Project Expenses**: Receives payment requests from Work-in-Progress Context
- **Lease Payments**: Receives lease payment instructions from IFRS16 Leasing

### Outbound Events
- **SettlementCreated**: Published when new settlement is processed
- **PaymentProcessed**: Published when payment is completed
- **InvoiceSettled**: Published when invoice is fully paid
- **VendorCreated**: Published when new vendor is registered

### Anti-Corruption Layers Required
- **Asset Integration**: Translate asset acquisition data to settlement context
- **WIP Integration**: Adapt project payment data to financial transaction format
- **Lease Integration**: Transform lease payment data to settlement format

## Data Consistency Requirements

### Strong Consistency
- Settlement transactions and amounts
- Vendor information and relationships
- Invoice-settlement relationships
- Currency and exchange rates

### Eventual Consistency
- Cross-context transaction references
- Reporting data synchronization
- Audit trail propagation

## API Boundaries

### Public Interface
```yaml
POST   /api/settlements              # Create settlement
GET    /api/settlements/{id}         # Get settlement
PUT    /api/settlements/{id}         # Update settlement
GET    /api/settlements              # List settlements
POST   /api/dealers                  # Create dealer
GET    /api/dealers/{id}             # Get dealer
PUT    /api/dealers/{id}             # Update dealer
POST   /api/invoices                 # Create invoice
GET    /api/invoices/{id}            # Get invoice
POST   /api/purchase-orders          # Create purchase order
GET    /api/accounts                 # Chart of accounts
```

### Internal Services
- SettlementService
- DealerService
- PaymentInvoiceService
- PurchaseOrderService
- TransactionAccountService
- SettlementCurrencyService

## Business Rules and Invariants

1. **Settlement Integrity**: Settlement amounts must match invoice totals
2. **Currency Consistency**: All related transactions must use consistent currency
3. **Vendor Validation**: Vendors must be validated before transaction processing
4. **Payment Authorization**: Settlements above threshold require approval
5. **Invoice Matching**: Purchase orders must match corresponding invoices
6. **Account Validation**: All transactions must reference valid chart of accounts

## Integration Patterns

### Synchronous Integration
- **Vendor Validation**: Real-time validation for asset purchases
- **Currency Conversion**: Real-time exchange rate application
- **Account Verification**: Immediate chart of accounts validation

### Asynchronous Integration
- **Settlement Notifications**: Event-driven notifications to other contexts
- **Audit Trail**: Asynchronous audit log generation
- **Reporting Updates**: Eventual consistency for reporting data

## Migration Considerations

### Current State
- Financial entities mixed with domain-specific logic
- Direct JPA relationships across multiple business domains
- Tightly coupled settlement-asset relationships

### Target State
- Isolated financial processing with clear boundaries
- Event-driven integration with other contexts
- Independent financial transaction processing

### Migration Risks
- Complex multi-context transactions require careful coordination
- Existing financial reports span multiple domains
- Currency and exchange rate dependencies across contexts

## Security Considerations

- **Payment Authorization**: Multi-level approval workflows
- **Audit Requirements**: Complete transaction audit trails
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive financial data protection
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to financial operations

## Team Ownership

- **Primary Team**: Financial Systems Team
- **Domain Expert**: Financial Controller
- **Technical Lead**: Senior Developer with financial domain expertise
- **Stakeholders**: Accounting Team, Treasury Team, Compliance Team
