## Story Information

**Epic:** 0.1 Azure Infrastructure Deployment  
**Story:** 0.1.1 Design Azure Terraform Infrastructure Architecture  
**Epic Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation)  
**Business Domain:** Infrastructure & DevOps  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Critical  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps team and system architects  
**I want** to design a comprehensive Terraform infrastructure architecture for Azure deployment of ERP microservices  
**So that** we can establish a scalable, secure, and maintainable cloud infrastructure foundation that supports all 6 microservices with proper networking, security, and monitoring capabilities  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Architecture Design
- [ ] **Azure Services Mapping**: Complete mapping of existing infrastructure to Azure services (AKS, PostgreSQL, Event Hubs, Key Vault, Blob Storage)
- [ ] **Terraform Module Structure**: Design modular Terraform architecture with networking, AKS, database, messaging, storage, monitoring, and security modules
- [ ] **Multi-Environment Strategy**: Define environment-specific configurations for dev, staging, and production with appropriate resource sizing
- [ ] **Security Architecture**: Design Azure Key Vault integration, managed identities, and network security groups

### Production-Readiness Gates
- [ ] **Gate 1 - Infrastructure Standards**: Terraform best practices, module structure, and documentation standards
- [ ] **Gate 2 - Security Compliance**: Azure security baseline, Key Vault integration, and network isolation
- [ ] **Gate 3 - Cost Optimization**: Resource sizing strategy and cost monitoring implementation
- [ ] **Gate 4 - Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, logging, alerting, and backup strategies
- [ ] **Gate 5 - Deployment Automation**: CI/CD integration and infrastructure validation

### Implementation Deliverables
- [ ] **Infrastructure Architecture Document**: Complete Azure service architecture with Terraform module design
- [ ] **Terraform Module Specifications**: Detailed specifications for all 7 infrastructure modules
- [ ] **Environment Configuration Strategy**: Multi-environment approach with resource sizing and cost estimates
- [ ] **Security Design**: Azure Key Vault integration and managed identity implementation
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: Plan for transitioning from existing Kubernetes to Azure infrastructure

### Azure Service Integration
- [ ] **Container Orchestration**: AKS cluster design with auto-scaling (2-10 replicas) and node pool configuration
- [ ] **Database Strategy**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with HA and backup configuration
- [ ] **Messaging Architecture**: Azure Event Hubs configuration for 6 microservice topics (asset, financial, lease, depreciation, WIP, reporting)
- [ ] **Storage Design**: Azure Blob Storage with private endpoints for documents, reports, backups, and audit logs

## Technical Requirements

### Terraform Architecture
- Modular design with 7 core modules: networking, AKS, database, messaging, storage, monitoring, security
- Environment-specific configurations with variable management
- State management strategy with remote backend
- Module versioning and dependency management

### Azure Services Configuration
- **AKS**: Multi-zone deployment with auto-scaling and Azure AD integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Flexible Server with HA, backup, and private endpoint connectivity
- **Event Hubs**: Kafka-compatible messaging with consumer groups for each microservice
- **Key Vault**: Secrets management with CSI driver integration for Kubernetes
- **Blob Storage**: Private endpoints with containers for different data types
- **Application Gateway**: Ingress controller with SSL termination and WAF

### Security Requirements
- Azure Key Vault for all secrets and certificates
- Managed Identity for service authentication
- Network Security Groups with least privilege access
- Private endpoints for all Azure services
- Azure Policy for compliance enforcement

### Cost Management
- Resource sizing strategy for each environment
- Azure Cost Management integration
- Reserved Instance recommendations
- Auto-scaling configuration for cost optimization

## Definition of Done

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete infrastructure architecture document with Azure service mappings
- [ ] Terraform module specifications with input/output definitions
- [ ] Multi-environment strategy with cost estimates and resource sizing
- [ ] Security architecture with Key Vault and managed identity design
- [ ] Migration strategy from existing infrastructure to Azure

### Design Validation
- [ ] Architecture review completed by technical team
- [ ] Security review for Azure compliance requirements
- [ ] Cost analysis validated with budget constraints
- [ ] Operational requirements addressed with monitoring strategy
- [ ] Integration points validated with existing microservices

### Implementation Readiness
- [ ] All Terraform module specifications defined
- [ ] Environment configurations planned with variable management
- [ ] Azure service dependencies identified and documented
- [ ] Migration strategy validated for zero-downtime requirements
- [ ] CI/CD integration strategy defined

## Dependencies

### Infrastructure
- Azure subscription with appropriate service quotas
- Terraform state storage (Azure Storage Account)
- Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- DNS management for custom domains
- SSL certificate management

### Services
- Existing microservices codebase analysis
- Current Kubernetes configuration review
- JHipster Registry integration requirements
- Authentication and authorization system integration

### Team
- Azure architecture review by cloud team
- Security review by security team
- Cost review by finance team
- Operations review for monitoring and alerting
- Business stakeholder validation for requirements

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Azure Service Limits**: Ensure service quotas meet scaling requirements
- **Cost Overruns**: Validate resource sizing against budget constraints
- **Security Gaps**: Comprehensive security review required
- **Migration Complexity**: Plan for seamless transition from existing infrastructure

### Mitigation Strategies
- Azure service limit review and quota increase requests
- Detailed cost modeling with monitoring and alerting
- Security baseline validation and compliance checking
- Phased migration approach with rollback procedures

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Complete Terraform module specifications for all 7 modules
- Multi-environment configuration strategy defined
- Security architecture validated against Azure best practices
- Cost estimates within approved budget ranges

### Business Metrics
- Infrastructure foundation ready for microservices deployment
- Scalability requirements met for future growth
- Security compliance validated for enterprise requirements
- Operational excellence standards established

## Notes

This story establishes the architectural foundation for the entire Azure infrastructure deployment. The design must support all 6 microservices while maintaining security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

The architecture follows Azure Well-Architected Framework principles and integrates with existing ERP system patterns for seamless migration.
