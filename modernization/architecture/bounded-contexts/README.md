# Bounded Context Definitions

This directory contains the bounded context definitions for the ERP System microservices architecture as part of Epic D4 - Bounded Context Separation.

## Overview

The ERP System has been analyzed and decomposed into 6 distinct bounded contexts based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:

1. **Asset Management Context** - Complete asset lifecycle management
2. **Financial Core Context** - Payment processing and financial operations
3. **IFRS16 Leasing Context** - Lease accounting compliance
4. **Depreciation Context** - Automated depreciation calculations
5. **Work-in-Progress Context** - Project work and capital expenditure tracking
6. **Reporting Context** - Cross-domain reporting and analytics

## Context Relationships

Each bounded context is designed to be autonomous while maintaining necessary integration points through well-defined interfaces and anti-corruption layers.

## Documentation Structure

- `asset-management-context.md` - Asset Management bounded context definition
- `financial-core-context.md` - Financial Core bounded context definition
- `ifrs16-leasing-context.md` - IFRS16 Leasing bounded context definition
- `depreciation-context.md` - Depreciation bounded context definition
- `work-in-progress-context.md` - Work-in-Progress bounded context definition
- `reporting-context.md` - Reporting bounded context definition
- `context-map.md` - Inter-context relationships and communication patterns
- `anti-corruption-layers.md` - Anti-corruption layer requirements and specifications
- `migration-strategy.md` - Phased migration approach and implementation plan

## Implementation Status

This documentation represents the completion of **Story D4.1: Define Bounded Context Boundaries** from Epic D4 - Bounded Context Separation.

## Next Steps

The bounded context definitions provide the foundation for:
- Story 4.2: Implement Anti-Corruption Layers
- Story 4.3: Extract Asset Management Context
- Story 4.4: Extract Financial Core Context
- Story 4.5: Prepare for Microservices Deployment
